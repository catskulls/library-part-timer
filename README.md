<h1> library part-timer </h1>

this is another javascript/css/html fishing minigame from a larger project i made roughly 5 months ago in a complete haze over christmas break with slight reqeires and revisions. as a disclaimer, i wrote this completely fucking drunk off my ass so the quality drops in random parts with this one is going to be crazy

this minigame is free to use for anyone who wants to spice up their homepage a bit under the <strong> Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International </strong> license. i spent way too much time writing vanilla javascript so the least i ask for is a credit somewhere lolol. i also request that you replace all the graphics because i drew most of them with a mouse in ms paint and they kind of bite and the character is just a manwhore i drew in 15 minutes but i like him

i've tried commenting the code so that this is easy for beginners to copypaste and replace with their own assets or whatever, but i make no guarantees. trying to debug my shit code is going to be a hell of a learning opportunity though! also FYI the only reason i'm uploading is to github is because i'm trying to share this code with my friends and codepen bites so fucking hard like?? all the professional developers on this site scare me please spare me i'm just a hobbyist

<strong><em>DISCLAIMER: THIS CODE IS REALLY, REALLY BAD</em></strong>

<h2> features of library part-timer </h2>
<ul>
  <li>NPC who you can talk to in order to start sorting</li>
  <li>currency earned for working</li>
  <li>different genres of books for different shelves</li>
  <li>you can click the NPC to bother him which is fun</li>
  <li>bonus feature: if the player is fucking useless and doesn't sort any books the NPC will mention that</li>
</ul>

<h2>no but how does this even work though</h2>

player is given a book and has to drag it to the shelf of the corresponding genre. the books have no clear genre set so the player has to do a bit of thinking in order to figure out where the book belongs based on its title and cover. if the player drags the book to the correct shelf they'll get a point, but if the incorrect shelf is chosen nothing will happen and the player can just drag it to another shelf.

for every 10 books sorted the player will earn 1 currency. my playtesters never got back to me so i don't know if this is any good, but you can like totally edit that yourself and make it "easier" or "harder" or whatever the fuck. 

<em>the player's currency is stored in localstorage due to the fact that this minigame was a part of that larger project where the localstorage currency total was used across an entire webpage instead of just this one minigame, so if you wanna configure something bigger with this you have everything you need lmfao</em>

<h2>in conclusion</h2>
that's about it, thank you. if you have any questions please email me at catskulls.png@proton.me! i'm very open to helping everyone new to web development and/or neocities try and get this code functional and modify it to match their own vision. self-expression is fun guys trust me you should all learn game dev
